# Spartans, prepare for glory!

Spartan tests are ordinary Ruby code samples.

```ruby
puts "Hello, world"             # => nil
1 + 1                           # => 2

```
If you want, you can just run them as a plain ruby file.

ruby examples/01_basics.rb

Running like this won't actually test anything, however, except that
the code runs.

```ruby
"natraps".reverse               # => "spartan"

```
If you install the 'rcodetools' gem and run the "xmpfilter" program
on the file, you'll see the special annotations are filled in with
the result of the annotated line.

```ruby
warn "This is STDERR"
puts "This is STDOUT"

```
(Look at the bottom of this section to see the output filled in.)

```ruby
2 + 2 # => 5

```
It's this last property of xmpfilter which makes Spartan
possible. When writing Spartan tests, you write xmp-annotated Ruby
code. But instead of just adding xmp comments, you also fill in the
values you _think_ will be generated by xmpfilter. Then you run
`spartan`.
